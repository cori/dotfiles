# dotfiles

Recently switched to using [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for dotfile config in addition to the defaults set up by oh-my-zsh.

## MacOS
Selected items from Mathias Bynens [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

## Glitch
For new [Glitch](https://glitch.com) projects, [glitch-init.sh](glitch-init.sh) sets up a nice console using [bash-it](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it).
